## üöÄ Setup & Installation

This project is currently contained within a single HTML file. To run it:

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file (e.g., `pokedex.html`).
2.  **Get a TCG API Key:**
    * Visit the [Pokemon TCG API Developers](https://dev.pokemontcg.io/) website.
    * Sign up or log in to obtain a free API key.
3.  **Configure API Key:**
    * Open the `.html` file you saved in a text editor.
    * Locate the following line within the `<script>` tag:
        ```javascript
        const TCG_API_KEY = 'a65acbfc-55e5-4d2c-9278-253872a1bc5a'; // Replace with your key
        ```
    * Replace the placeholder string `'a65acbfc-55e5-4d2c-9278-253872a1bc5a'` (or `'YOUR_API_KEY'`) with the actual API key you obtained.
    * **Important:** Keep your API key private. If deploying this project publicly, consider implementing a backend proxy to handle TCG API requests securely instead of embedding the key directly in the frontend code.
4.  **Open in Browser:** Open the modified `.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## üéÆ Usage

1.  **Browse:** Click the "Gen" buttons at the top to load Pok√©mon from a specific generation into the main grid.
2.  **Search:** Enter a Pok√©mon's name (e.g., "Pikachu") or National Pok√©dex ID (e.g., "25") into the search bar at the top and click "Search" or press Enter. This will open the detail view directly.
3.  **View Details:** Click on any Pok√©mon card in the grid to open its detailed view in a lightbox.
4.  **Navigate Details:**
    * Use the "Game Info" and "Card Info" tabs.
    * Within "Game Info", use the "Summary", "Stats", "Abilities", and "Moves" sub-tabs.
    * Toggle the shiny version using the star icon (<i class="fas fa-star"></i>) next to the Pok√©mon image.
    * Select different game versions from the dropdown in the "Summary" tab to see different Pok√©dex entries.
    * Use the sort buttons ("Default", "Val ‚Üì", "Val ‚Üë") in the "Stats" tab.

6.  **Close Lightboxes:** Click the close button ('X') or click outside the main content area of the lightboxes to close them.

## üìù Configuration

* **TCG API Key:** As mentioned in the Setup section, the `TCG_API_KEY` constant within the `<script>` tag *must* be set to a valid key from [pokemontcg.io](https://dev.pokemontcg.io/) for the TCG card features to work correctly.

## üí° Potential Improvements / To-Do

* Separate JavaScript and CSS into external files (`.js`, `.css`) for better organization and maintainability.
* Implement more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
* Add display for Evolution Chains.
* Include Pok√©mon location/encounter data.
* Show more detailed move information (Type, Power, Accuracy, PP, Category).
* Support other move learning methods (TM/HM/TR, Egg, Tutor).
* Add a type effectiveness chart/display.
* Enhance responsive design for a wider range of screen sizes (mobile, tablet).
* Improve accessibility (review ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
* Consider using a simple build tool (like Parcel or Vite) if the project grows, for bundling, minification, and development server features.
* Implement a backend proxy for the TCG API key if deploying publicly.
* Add unit or integration tests.
